I did a small survey of startups in the last 20 years. Almost all of them are applying new tech to solving old problems.
Moving people and things around, giving people food and places to sleep,
helping people talk to other people far away…

Actually, let's be real, most of them are applications of **COMPUTERS** to age old problems. There has been an exponential
explosion of innovation in the last 40 years and it all points to 2 things: computers and the internet.

The first question I had was "What is so great about computers that it has led to this gold rush?" Computers are:

- Fast
- Connected
- Obedient

This enables a lot of interesting tools for solving problems. Let's go one level higher and look at some of the basic
things computers enable:

### Reporting

Real-time insight into your information. Normally very labor intensive to aggregate your data,
you can filter, sort and group data into time series and trends instantly and in infinite
combinations. You can save these “views” into your data into dashboards. This was obviously
extremely valuable to businesses and was the first boom for computing. Billion dollar businesses
are still being built and sold solving this very old problem.

### Undo (1980s)

Cheap simulations, conceptualizations and experimentation. Undo vs whiteout. Editing long text reflows layout, etc.

### Ubiquity

important up to date information available everywhere

### Real-time

work on the same thing together from anywhere and no bumping elbows. Content creation, markets, gaming

### Redundancy

your information backed up automatically to multiple locations. Office can burn down or destroyed in earthquake and never lose your information.

### Secure

information protected by a password in your head and multi-factor authentication can, in theory, be more secure than written on sticky notes.

### Trustless

blockhain and cryptography allow strangers to interact and collaborate with practical guarantees of no cheating.

### Automation and prediction

save time and work by figuring out things for you. Suggesting things you might like or want to do. Perform actions automatically.

## Conclusion

So here's the formula for building a software startup: Choose an industry you are passionate about
and see what problems they have that these software solutions can solve.
